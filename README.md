# TensorFlock

## Compilation
First, ensure that you have opam version 1.2.2 or greater installed. Then just run "make".  Our project is packaged with an opam file that will install any needed dependencies as a local pin.

## Execution
After running make, you can execute our compiler by running:
./toplevel.native -a tests/<file name>.tf

## Testing
To run our tests, run "make test".

## Syntax
We have yet to implement function application.
