The operators on integer, double, boolean, and tensor literal types
supported by TensorFlock are:

\subsection{Tensor Operators}
The following operators can operate on tensors in a per-component manner:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Exponentiation (to a scalar)
    \item Unary Operators
    \item Multiplicative Operators
    \item Additive Binary Operators
    \item Relational 
    \item Equality
    \item Logical And
    \item Logical Or
\end{itemize}
For example, the following function declaration is well defined:
\begin{lstlisting}
scalar_mult : Double -> T<a,b> -> T<a,b>;
scalar_mult n t = n * t[i,j];
\end{lstlisting}
This will return a new tensor of the same shape with each component multiplied
by n. Likewise, equality comparison is calculated componentwise. Relational
operations, logical and, and logical on tensors are only defined on rank
0 tensors.
\\
For any of these operations between tensors, correct tensor shape is
compile-time checked to determine whether the operation is allowed.

\subsection{Scope and Definition}
Function definition in a function declaration, must have an
identifier followed by zero or more formal arguments on the left-hand side. On
the right-hand side, the expression given may be followed by a scope of locally
declared variables. For example:
\begin{lstlisting}
addDouble : Double; 
addDouble = a + b; 
{ 
    a : Double; a = 3.14;
    b : Double; b = 6.28;
}
\end{lstlisting}
Definition that occurs in the declaration scope such that the operation 
on the variables returns the correct type as specified by the function header
is well defined.
